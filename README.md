# resumewebsite
First dive into HTML and CSS. Fun little project turning my resume into a website. 

-------------------------------------------VERSION 1.0 APRIL 8, 2020-------------------------------------------
Got through the majority of this in one day (roughly 6 hours). Learned alot about the basic structure/syntax of HTML. The only problems I ran into were in regards to buttons. Funcctionality wise, nothing is wrong (I even addede cool effects like hover shading!) My only issues came when moving them around. THe only way I was able to get them to be moved was by using 

<style>
.btn{
  position: relative;
  left: 700px;
  }
</style>

Iniitially, I thought this was going to work because I was only viewing on fullscreen. However, when minimizing my browser, I realized that the pixels were based on screen resolution, causing what used to be centered to turn into a left skewed button. NOT ideal.

I tried exploring options like wrapping the buttons into div, but even then I had issues. This time, applying div would just completely remove the styling I had specific to each button. Very annoying. In this version, I just left the buttons in their default state. Maybe I will come back to this and fix them later. I do plan on purchasing the domain sameharsalla.com and hosting a MUCH more advanced and polished website for job/internship recruitment purposes in college.

Finally, shoutout to Font Awesome for the sick icon library
