# resumewebsite
First dive into HTML and CSS. Fun little project turning my resume into a website. 

-----------------------------------------------VERSION 1.0 APRIL 8, 2020-----------------------------------------------
Got through the majority of this in one day (roughly 6 hours). Learned alot about the basic structure/syntax of HTML. The only problems I ran into were in regards to buttons. Functionality wise, nothing is wrong (I even added cool effects like hover shading!) My only issues came when moving them around. THe only way I was able to get them to be moved was by using 

<style>
.btn{
  position: relative;
  left: 700px;
  }
</style>

Iniitially, I thought this was going to work because I was only viewing on fullscreen. However, when minimizing my browser, I realized that the pixels were based on screen resolution, causing what used to be centered to turn into a left skewed button. NOT ideal.

I tried exploring options like wrapping the buttons into div, but even then I had issues. This time, applying div would just completely remove the styling I had specific to each button. Very annoying. In this version, I just left the buttons in their default state. Maybe I will come back to this and fix them later. I do plan on purchasing the domain sameharsalla.com and hosting a MUCH more advanced and polished website for job/internship recruitment purposes in college.

Finally, shoutout to Font Awesome for the sick icon library

Spent a few hours working to change the overall layout from a very basic one page design, into what it is now. It actually looks like a webiste! I really worked on making the menu functional and learned how to link back different HTML files. I tried adding a search bar but I ran out of time, might touch back on this later tonight. Still didn't figure out how to position the buttons (problem stated in V1.0). 

As far as next steps, I plan to explore the mechanics of websites and try and clone cool features I see on the web. I dont think I will go into the beuatification of my project until I have the structure that I really want solidified. Happy Tax Day, and heres to web development!
